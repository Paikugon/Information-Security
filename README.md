This is my personal project for "Information Security" subject at university.

This project only focuses on some simple encryption techniques 

I've only had them process undercase English letters, so the processes will ignore other characters. Do keep that in mind when you test them

 ## How to use:
- xxx.java files in src folder contains the encryption and decryption processes (there might or might not be some pre/post processing in the action buttons functions, you should check them just in case)
- Run the xxxWindow.java files and you'll be able to use their coresponding cipher technique

If you have any questions/suggestions, feel free to contact me with informations in my profile, or with Discord username "paikugon"
