This is my personal project for "Information Security" subject at university.

This project only focuses on some simple classic symmetric key encryption techniques (where the sender and receiver use the same key to encrypt and decrypt message) such as Caesar's push technique, Vigenere's technique, etc.
I only make them to process undercase English letters only (no spaces, either), no keep that in mind when you test them

If you have any questions/suggestions, feel free to contact me with informations in my profile, or through Discord username "paikugon"
